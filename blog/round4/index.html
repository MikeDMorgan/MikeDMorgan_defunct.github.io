    <div id="content">
        <p>2017 is over, and there&rsquo;s a pretty big dent in January.  I started my running challenge to try to motivate me
back into running generally, hill running specifically, and because I like to tell people I think suffering is
good for the soul.  What better time of year to suffer, than Christmas? (I get on with my family pretty well,
so they aren&rsquo;t <em>really</em> a source of suffering tbh).  Of course I&rsquo;m talking about going for a windy, sleety
run on Christmas day.</p>

<p>My mum lives in North Hampshire, and seeing as I was down for the festive period, I thought it would be an
ideal opportunity to tick off not one, but two hills from the list; the two highest to date as well.  Pilot hill (286m)
in Hampshire, and Walbury Hill (297m) in Berkshire both stand on the Wayfarer&rsquo;s Way that cuts across the North
Hampshire downs (it also apparently starts just past <a href="http://www.britishwalks.org/walks/Named/WayfarersWalk.php">Walbury Hill at Inkpen Beacon</a>).  My Mum and I drove out to the carpark
at Coombe Gibbet; she went off to walk Ella, the family dog, whilst I ran.  As we got closer to our
destination it became apparently clear that the weather would not be on my side.  The wind was howling off
of the top of the ridgeway, driving the freezing sleet and rain like icy knives straight through me.</p>

<p>My route initially took me off the hill and down into the quaint village of Coombe.  Seeing as we were parked
so close to the summit of one of the hills, I didn&rsquo;t want to peak (pun intended) too early.  It also turns
out that running straight down hill for a mile before warming up is almost as much fun as running straight up
one.  You live and learn!</p>

<p><a href="/img/hants_berks_route1.jpg">the route in all its glory</a></p>

<p>From Coombe I was to take a cross-country route, up Sugglestone Down to a radio mast before a long slow drop
down in to Faccombe (Faccombe all!).  I am nothing, if not consistent, so I got lost, as I have on nearly
every single one of these runs.  I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s my shocking sense of direction or orientation (Julie
will say it&rsquo;s my lack of orientation no doubt), but sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to find what should be marked
footpaths.  After a very steep slog up Sugglestone Down (I may have walked a little bit&hellip;), I set off across
a field in what I thought was the right general direction; I could even see the radio mast I was aiming for.
Unfortunately it seems that most of the paths cut straight across farmers fields.  Fields that tend to get
ploughed on an annual basis.  Sometimes they plough across the paths and obliterated.  See where this is
going?  Anyway, after running around a cornfield, scaring the bejeesus out of every pheasant and partridge in
Hampshire, and one or two buzzards (so cool!), I found the road I&rsquo;d been looking for.  In my defence, these
little detours are getting shorter each time, I think I probably only added on an extra kilometre, if that.</p>

<p>The road down to Faccombe (it is as rude as it sounds), was a good opportunity to settle into a steady pace.
I was particularly mindful that I had agreed to meet my mother back at the car at a specific time, and I was
already behind schedule (thankfully the turkey was in the oven), but we were expecting guests.</p>

<p>As I keep  banging on, this challenge is about running up hills, so I&rsquo;ve have deliberately planned several
ups and downs into each route, not necessarily just the intended summits.  I&rsquo;d come down the off the
ridgeway, and thrown one hill into the route already, so it was time to get back up onto the ridgeway proper.
Whitehorse hill in Oxford was short, but steep, and the hills in Cambridgeshire and Essex were
fairly unimpressive.  My point is that up until this point I hadn&rsquo;t actually run up many hills.  The long
slog out of Faccombe was a real test, and to be honest, I was found wanting.  The muddy path took a short
dip down to the bottom of the valley, before heading up through woods and along field boundaries before
depositing me on the Wayfarer&rsquo;s Way.  I struggled with this hill, <em>really</em> struggled.  About three quarters
of the way up I just couldn&rsquo;t keep it up.  I told myself that I stopped because it looked like there was a
path off to my left I might have to take.  I&rsquo;d looked at the map in Faccombe, so I knew that the only
navigational choice was when the path ran out.  In all honesty, I was absolutely bollocksed.  My fitness was
not up to scratch, and this hill really hit that home.  I can make excuses about there not being any hills
in and around Cambridge to train on, but the truth is I&rsquo;d let my running and training slip in the previous
months.  The fact that this was the first hill run in nearly six months is testament to that fact.  I have
resolved to not let such long lapses happen again, but I don&rsquo;t like to make promises I can&rsquo;t keep!  I&rsquo;ll
just have to be a bit more mindful about keeping the running up.  That&rsquo;s not an issue right now as I&rsquo;m
training for the Cambridge half marathon in March.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I made it on to the Wayfarers way, where I was greeted first by an icy cold slap of wind to the
chops, and secondly by a quagmire.  I had thought that from this point it would be easy sailing, it&rsquo;s pretty
flat all the way, and I still had about two and a half miles to get back to the car (and the awaiting
turkey).  I considered walking, but I don&rsquo;t think it would have made a huge amount of difference.  I slipped
my way along the footpath, past a rather bemused family, and set off across a field in hope of finding a
trig point that marked the summit of Pilot hill.</p>

<p><img src="/img/pilot_hill.jpg" alt="a &quot;view&quot; from pilot hill" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/pilot_selfie.jpg" alt="pilot hill selfie" /></p>

<p>It was at this point that the bemused family&rsquo;s dog started playing a game.  A game that involves it getting
as close to me as it dared, whilst barking, then sprinting away as fast as possible, intentionally in the
opposite direction of it&rsquo;s rather embarassed looking owner.  Having helped entice the dog back to it&rsquo;s owner
I jumped back onto the muddy path (carefully), and carried on slipping, squelching and sliding my way to the
next summit.  Trees, metal barriers, deer, and deep filthy pits of muds were leapt over, siddled past and
ineleganty clambered over (not the deer).  The second summit, another trig point, was smack bang in the middle of another
farmers field.  I figured that on Christmas day the farmer wouldn&rsquo;t begrudge some mad runner jogging to an
arbitrary spot in the middle of their field.  I clambered over the fence, and in my haste totally missed the
ground, sending my foot flying upwards and my bum downwards rather more rapidly than I&rsquo;d bargained for. In
truly suave style I scrabbled to get up by clutching at the metal gate, trying to get some purchase in the
mud.  Probably looking somewhat like Bambi on ice, I found my feet and ran across the field towards the trig
point.  I was running straight into the icy rain now, and my sense of humour was on the verge of failing me.
Until of course I realised this was exactly what I&rsquo;d come for.  Freezing wind, icy rain, treachorous mud;
perfect!</p>

<p>I made it to the trig point, snapped a selfie and one of the glorious &ldquo;view&rdquo; (judge for yourselves), before
running back to the fence.  I sent my mum a quick message to say I was 5 minutes out (it turns out I
actually sent it to the wrong parent and got a bemused phone call from my father), and finished the last
half a mile or so in the driving rain.  No time to stretch out or catch my breath I jumped in the car and
we set off home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve ended all of these posts so far with the lessons I&rsquo;ve learnt, and what I&rsquo;ll change for the next.  I
didn&rsquo;t have any particular take away lessons, aside from lack of fitness.  I&rsquo;ve finished the year with 5
