                <p><strong>[Insert standard excuses about writing a blog post months after the run]</strong></p>

<p>Julie and I have a very similar sense of humor, so I&rsquo;m somewhat ashamed that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed
the county hill that would obviously be the most fun. Brown. Willy. <em>tee hee hee</em>. This hill, by
far, was the most hotly anticipated for us. I think Julie spotted the name sometime in the
summer. A very quick Google of <code>Brown Willy</code> (with the parental filters on), turned up a dream
come true - the <a href="https://www.trurorunningclub.org.uk/trc-events/brown-willy-run/">Brown Willy News Year day run!</a> We figured that as we were
travelling half way across the country over Christmas, we may as well go the whole hog and finish
in Cornwall for New Year (also, this is one of the furthest points from Cambridge on the South
Coast). The race starts and finishes at the (in)famous Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor.  Little did we
know that this pub was famous, as it forms the setting for a book of the same name by Daphne du
Maurier. Numerous ghost stories had been reported by guests staying at the inn over the
centuries, some no doubt fueled by the dark corners and even darker rum they serve.</p>

<p><img src="/img/jamaica_sign.jpg" alt="Jamaica Inn" /></p>

<p>What a great location to see in the New Year! We booked a couple of nights, and over the course
of a week slowly made our way down to Cornwall, stopping with friends and family along the way to
enjoy the festive season (and train on a few hills).</p>

<p><img src="/img/brown_willy_map.png" alt="Route map" /></p>

<p>The route was a pretty straightforward there and back again, with a little circuit up the side of
Brown Willy then off the back and around the base to pick up the same trail. As this was an
organised run it meant the navigation would (hopefully) be trivial. We&rsquo;d heard that the moors
can be pretty grim at that time of year, and had been warned several times about the mud - more
mud more fun! The race start time was 11am on New Years day, so there was plenty of time to relax
after the nights celebrations (though we only just made it to midnight :/). The crowds started to
build from about half 9, then they swelled (I think  close to 500 runners turned up). Officially
this isn&rsquo;t a race, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop the first back from being hotly contested. We&rsquo;d had a
good few practice runs through the week, but this was unfamiliar terrain to us, and it looked
like there were some <em>very</em> serious runners in the crowd. Our goal was to get there and back in
one piece.</p>

<p><img src="/img/brown_willy_begin.jpg" alt="Start line" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/brown_willy_start.jpg" alt="Starters orders" /></p>

<p>From the start point at the Jamaica Inn we followed the road round under the A30 and along a few
country lanes until we were diverted onto a rutted farm track. It was quite tight, with only 2
runners abreast which meant having to speed check and keep our wits about us in the slightly
cramped conditions. Soon enough, after about a mile or so the track opened up into the moor and
gave us a bit more space to settle into a more comfortable rhythm. Everyone was in high spirits,
and clearly enjoying the event atmosphere. This is something I&rsquo;ve found from previous running
events, that everyone is in a really good mood and wants to be there. We&rsquo;re all in the same boat,
embracing the suffering! The route headed up and over a few hills (Tolborough Tor and Catshole
Tor according to the map), when Brown Willy emerged across the boggy moor.</p>

<p><img src="/img/brown_willy_distant.jpg" alt="A glimpse of Brown Willy" /></p>

<p>A couple of miles across the bogs, we carefully picked the right, and mostly wrong, paths to
avoid the worst of the deep mud. Thankfully Truro running club had laid out markers all along
the route to help guide us. They did an absolutely sterling job at organising the event, I doff
my cap to your skills. As we closed in on the base of Brown Willy the front runners started to
pass us. I don&rsquo;t know who &ldquo;won&rdquo; in the end, but there was a bit of a gap between the &ldquo;first&rdquo; and
&ldquo;second&rdquo; place at that point. Perhaps even more impressive was the young teenager keeping up
with the adults in the top 10 or so runners.</p>

<p><img src="/img/cornwall_profile.png" alt="Brown willy elevation" /></p>

<p>This was my first proper fell race, and I&rsquo;ve read and heard repeatedly that if you can&rsquo;t see the
top of the hill then walk. Other than my lack of fitness on Moel Famau, this is the only other
county top so far where that was necessary. This part of the run formed another bottle neck as
runners slowly picked their way up the steep side of Brown Willy. I would have liked to move a
little bit faster, but caution is the greater part of valor, so it was better in the long run as
we were only at the half-way point by then. After trudging up the hill, for what felt like 10
minutes, we emerged onto the top, and the highest point in Cornwall!</p>

<p><img src="/img/brown_willy_top.jpg" alt="Brown willy top" /></p>

<p>The top was crawling with elated runners, so we took a few photos, including the ubiquitous
summit snap (thanks random person), and enjoyed the view. The cold wind kept us from hanging
around for too long, it was January 1st after all.</p>

<p><img src="/img/brown_willy_crowds.jpg" alt="Brown willy summit" />
<img src="/img/brown_willy_stones.jpg" alt="Brown willt cairn" /></p>

<p>Before the cold took hold we made the descent off the back of Brown Willy. I quite like this
part of hill running as you can let loose a little and just let gravity do most of the hard
work. However, the broken boggy rocky path had other ideas. We carefully picked our way down
the steep track, trying not to turn an ankle on the hidden rocks and rabbit holes. Elated with
having made it to the top of Cornwall we made our way around the base of the hill and re-joined
the route back to the Jamaica Inn. Back through the mud, back through the sticky bog. Although
this year was reputedly some of the driest conditions in the history of this run, it still
didn&rsquo;t stop us from getting caked in peaty mud.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mid_mud.jpg" alt="Julie running in a bog" /></p>

<p>The mud continued until we got back to the farm track, by which point we had well and truly
settled into a comfortable pace, and were just enjoying the ride. There&rsquo;s always a sting in the
tail, and this was no exception. The final rise up to the Jamaica Inn paled in comparison to
Brown Willy, but ensured that we had to really earn this county top.</p>

<p><img src="/img/muddy_shoes.jpg" alt="Muddy shoes" /></p>

<p>I think this was the first time in quite a while that we&rsquo;d hit all of the orignal requirements
for a county top. Nice one Cornwall. I <em>really</em> enjoyed this hill, and so did Julie. Without the
pressure of navigating we could just settle into the run and really enjoy the scenery. I think
I&rsquo;ll try to find some more county tops that have races in the future.</p>
