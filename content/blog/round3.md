Well it's been quite a while since my last official county hill run, 3 months by my reckoning.  In all honesty that was maybe leaving it a bit too long, but I have to also be honest with myself; this is a long-term challenge.  In those 3 months I have been keeping myself pretty busy, and my time was largely dominated by training and preparation for a week in the Alps.  It was well worth it, and I had an absolutely fantastic time out in Chamonix.  It was my first real proper taste of being in an alpine environment, without being on a skiing trip.

The bonus was that training for a week of climbing in mountaineering turned out be pretty good prep for running up hills in the UK!

I planned this run waaaay back in Easter, on a short break in the Pyrenees with some friends, and old housemates, from Oxford (that was another great trip).
