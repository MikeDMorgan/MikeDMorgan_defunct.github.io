Great Chishill.  It sounds like it should be some towering natural edifice, rather than a scrappy corner of a field next to a small copse of trees.  It was a good start though, and perhaps a good way to revise my expectations a little.  The lack of hills in and around Cambridge, and my distinct lack of fitness, made this a somewhat tougher challenge than I had expected.

I planned the route out yesterday after picking up a few OS maps from a look outdoor shop (there's only one in Cambridge that actually sells maps, so no points for guessing).  I can't work out how to render or insert a Google map with the route on, so here's a crappy photo of the route drawn out on a map (OS Explorer 194).  The small red cross is the "summit", in the loosest possible sense.

And to prove it here's a link to my Endomondo page with the route and elevations:

I was joined by my housemate Fred, which I was very grateful of by the end, as I was flagging on the last slog back to the car (and the awaiting beer).  I've already broken one of my rules, which was to bring back a keepsake of some sort; I couldn't find any little stones.  I think I might make this a very flexible rule, afterall, I've got the maps, "summit" selfie and Endomondo records.  Perhaps for some of the hills that are a little further afield I'll bring back something a bit more special.
